I created a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I used HTML to structure the interface, CSS to style and design a user-friendly layout, and JavaScript to handle the logic and functionality of the calculator. This project helped me understand event handling, DOM manipulation, and the use of functions in JavaScript. It was a great hands-on experience in building an interactive web application from scratch.
